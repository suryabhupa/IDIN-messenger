Hello, this will be the readme documentation for the communication application files.

It's recommended to install virtualenvwrapper

To install python packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Rename sample_local_settings to local_settings and fill in the info (or get file from someone else)

To run server:
  python run.py

To initialize the database, run db upgrade as shown below

To change database structure:
  python manage.py db migrate # creates python migration files
  python manage.py db upgrade # runs migration files to alter the database
  
To apply changes to the heroku database:
  after pushing code,

  heroku run python manage.py db upgrade --app twilio-messenger 

  migrate is not necessary as the migration files will be transfered
